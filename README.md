# little-leaf-learning
Little Leaf Learning is a nature-based educational web application designed with a strong focus on autism-friendly and neurodiverse-inclusive design.
The application emphasizes low sensory load, predictable navigation, soft color palettes and pressure-free interactions. Learning content is presented visually with simple language, optional audio narration and interactive matching games without timers or negative feedback.
The goal of the application is to create a safe, calming and engaging digital learning environment that supports children, especially those who benefit from structured and sensory-considerate interfaces.
